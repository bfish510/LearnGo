LearnGo
=======

Using Miek Gieben's Learning Go book. This repo is for me to work on every question at the end of each section to make sure I understand the material.

I will use the syntax chapter-questionNumber-b(efore) or a(fter) as my commit summary to determine which question was commited and if I had already looked at the answer or not or I know if I made a change to correct something.
